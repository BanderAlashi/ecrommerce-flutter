# Basic Ecommerce app

🛍️ Flutter Mini Market App (University Project)
This was my first Flutter project built during university. It's a basic mini-market app that showcases essential Flutter skills like:

🧭 Navigation between pages

🛒 Displaying and managing items in a shopping cart

🎨 Clean UI design using Flutter widgets

📝 Note: This version doesn't include any backend integration (no database or networking).
🚀 I'm currently working on a new, improved version of this app with full backend support and better scalability — stay tuned!
